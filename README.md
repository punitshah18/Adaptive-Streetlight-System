# Adaptive-Streetlight-System
Energy-saving should always be one of our top priorities, and with the current state of the Earth, it should be now more than ever. 

The street light system, titled SMRT Lite, is an adaptive system that grants drivers and walkers alike the peace of mind that they are 
always being looked after when driving or travelling respectively. Like those in Norway, the system will have similar capabilities, 
in that they will start at a set low-level brightness, and gradually increase to maximum brightness. The setup will consist of an 
STM32 Nucleo, in congregation with an infrared sensor, breadboard, LEDs, resistors as well as a mechanical build of the street lights.
